# Pyssistant
 
Simple assistant to correct Python programming exercises. It loops a directory injecting test cases and opening the file being corrected in VS Code. Some day it will also check if the answer is correct.

Test cases must be written into [injection.txt](https://github.com/FelipeMarra/pyssistant/blob/main/injection.txt), separated by an enter, that is, a `\n`, including one at the end of the file.
